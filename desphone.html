                I used <a class="text" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a> to create a smartphone that the user can interact with. The screen can be turned on and off, and there are many apps on the homescreen to play thorough.

                Pictured in this image is the "Maze" app, which will automatically generate a maze that you can attempt to solve. Other games include one similar to "Flappy Bird", and one similar to "Geometry Dash".

            <p>
                Other apps include a colour picker, accurate clock, calculator, and a drawing app.

                Here is a video I made when I originally completed this project, going over the features of the graph. It was a submission for an art contest held by Desmos. The video is about 15 minutes long - if you'd like to experiment with the graph for yourself, it may be more fun to explore it before watching!
