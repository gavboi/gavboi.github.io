    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my page! Here, I have a highlight of some of the personal projects I've done. All projects can also be found through <a href="https://www.github.com/gavboi" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a>.

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    
        <h3>Small Tools</h3>
        
            <h4>Secret Santa Helper (WIP)</h4>
            <p>
                This tool allows groups to create Secret Santa-style assignments, such that everyone is able to participate - even the person using the tool! Assignments are made automatically, can be set to avoid assignments between specific people or assignments from previous years, and can be sent out automatically by email.
            </p>
            <p>Made using: Python</p>

            <h4>Window Tweaks</h4>
            <p>
                This tool allows pretty much any window to be set to always stay on top, or to become semi-transparent.
            </p>
            <p>Made using: AutoHotKey</p>

        <h3>Gaming-related Projects</h3>
        
            <h4>Bloons TD6 Farming Script (WIP)</h4>
            <p>
                This script repeatedly plays the game and wins, so that you can level up your in-game characters (monkeys) and earn in-game money.

        <h3>Desmos-related Projects</h3>
        
            <h4>Desphone</h4>
            <p>
                In the desmos web graphing calculator, I created a mock smartphone. The user is able to interact with it to play games, solve puzzles, draw, and use a calculator amongst other things. 
            </p>
            <p>Made using: Desmos Graphing Calculator</p>

            <p><br></p>
            
            <h4>Desmos Plotter</h4>
            <p>
                If you want to have the equation of a line with a very specific shape, this tool lets you place and drag lines to shape them as needed so that you can simply copy the resulting equation.
            </p>
            <p>Made using: HTML, Desmos API</p>

            <h4>Picture to Dots</h4>
            <p>
                This script takes an image and returns a bunch of dots, that can either be viewed in an HTML page or in Desmos.
